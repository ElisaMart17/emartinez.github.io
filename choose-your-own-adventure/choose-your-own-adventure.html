        <p>Somewhere in the world there is a little cat called Lola that loves to smell flowers. She loves going on long walks and smelling the flowers and today was not an exception. But something different happened today.</p>
        <p>Like usual after Lola woke up from her long walk she decided to go into a walk and smell flowers, but today she decided to take a new path to find new flowers to smell. A new path that she never was and didnâ€™t know where to take her. After a couple hours after smelling a lot of flowers she realized that she didn't know where she was, and didn't know how to go back. She was lost. </p>
        <p><strong>Do you want to help Lola get back?</strong></p>
