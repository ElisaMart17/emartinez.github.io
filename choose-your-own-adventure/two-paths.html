        <h1>Two paths</h1>
        <p>
           Lola starts walking around looking for a way back home and after a couple minutes she bumps into her first dilema: two paths.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>One path with a lot of beautiful flowers</strong>  and <strong>another with dead trees and no flowers.</strong> 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>What path should Lola take?</strong>
        </p>
